This project titled "File Handling Program in C" was developed as part of the CODTECH internship to demonstrate basic file operations such as creating, writing, reading, and appending data to a file using the C programming language. The program was written and tested on the Programiz Online C Compiler, a user-friendly platform that allows easy coding and execution without requiring any software installation. Due to the sandbox environment of Programiz, the file operations were performed in the /tmp/ directory. In this project, a file named myfile.txt was created and the initial content “this is my internship question and I have to submit it in GitHub” was written to it. The program then read and displayed this content, appended a new line “This line is appended to the file,” and displayed the updated content again. This project helped in understanding how to use important file-handling functions such as fopen(), fprintf(), fgets(), and fclose() in C. Learning file handling is essential for developing applications that involve data storage, such as text editors, log files, database systems, and many real-world software solutions.
